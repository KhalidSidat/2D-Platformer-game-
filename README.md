# 2D-Platformer-game-
2D Platformer Game (Python / Pygame)
Overview

This project is an in-progress 2D platformer game built using Python and Pygame.
It is being developed as a personal project to demonstrate core game development concepts, clean code structure, and object-oriented design for job applications.

The game currently includes multiple levels, player movement with physics, enemy behavior, and collision handling. Additional features and polish are planned.

Features (Current)

Player movement (left/right, jumping)

Gravity and platform collision detection

Multiple levels with level transitions

Basic enemy AI with patrol behavior

Enemy collision logic (stomp vs. damage)

Modular, object-oriented code structure

Consistent game loop with frame control

Planned Features

Sprite animations

Background rendering and parallax scrolling

Sound effects and music

Improved enemy variety and behaviors

Health / lives system

Menu and pause screen

Expanded level design

Technologies Used

Python 3

Pygame

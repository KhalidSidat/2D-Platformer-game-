2D Platformer Game (Python / Pygame)

This project is an in-progress 2D platformer game built using Python and Pygame.
It is being developed as a personal project to demonstrate core game development concepts, clean code structure, and object-oriented design practice.

The game currently includes levels, player movement with physics, enemy behavior, and collision handling. Additional features will be added in the near future hopefully.
